# Genetic + Machine

**GeneticMachine** is a tool for making experiments on AI algorithms. It's based on simple abstract architecture and focused at learning algorithms.

Although, the current development goal is to implement and solve so called 'labyrinth' task - an abstract long-distance navigation task.

Please, visit [wiki](https://github.com/ZloVechno/genetic-machine/wiki) to learn more.

**Version 0.1 has been released!**

## In a few words
```scala
import org.geneticmachine._
import org.geneticmachine.navigation.{LabyrinthRobot, DijkstraBrain, LabyrinthStatus}
import org.geneticmachine.machine.GeneticMachine
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global
import scala.util.Success

// create local server
new GeneticMachine("GeneticMachine")

// connect to server through tcp
remote("GeneticMachine@127.0.0.1:7779") {
  using(DijkstraBrain).startWithNew.
    testWith(LabyrinthRobot.sampleFactory).repeat(3)
}.onComplete {
  case Success(results: Experiment.Result[LabyrinthStatus]) =>
    println(results.mkString("\n"))

  case other =>
    println(other)
}
```
